# Quest Engine

Quest Engine is (or will be) a game engine made in rust with the following resources:

- WGPU as the graphics API.
- EGUI for the gui of the engine.

Please keep in mind that (at least for the moment) this is a just-for-fun project. If what you want is to make games for real and publishing them, this is not the engine for you (yet).
